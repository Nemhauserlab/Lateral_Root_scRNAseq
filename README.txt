File	Description
main_analysis.R	"R script to run Monocle 3 on the data using the matrix.mtx, barcodes.tsv, and genes.tsv files from GEO158761 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE158761)"
stele_markers_used.tsv	set of stele marker genes used in main_analysis.R to help make stele UMAP.
ce_markers_used.tsv	set of endodermis marker genes used in main_analysis.R to help make endodermis UMAP 
run_seurat_integration.R	R script to combine with the data with a larger dataset using Seurat v3 (see rebuttal)
markerLinesEnrichedGenes	set of marker genes generated by Benfey et al. 2007 used by main_analysis.R to calculate average marker gene expression. Also includes a table of pericycle markers made by Parizot et al. 2012
GLM_and_MWW.R	R script to perform GLM using Monocle 3 (cell cluster comparisons and pseudotime) as well as perform MWW. Please use the rds files from GEO158761 as input.
paper_figures.R	"R script to create some of the base figures seen in the paper. Because UMAP can be stochastic, please use the rds files provided from GEO158761 as input."
xpp_lrp_mat_pseudotime.txt	short version of Supplemental Figure 1 used by GLM and MWW.R to visualize genes of interest.
endodermis_pseudotime.txt	short version of Supplemental Figure 3 used by GLM and MWW.R to visualize genes of interest.
